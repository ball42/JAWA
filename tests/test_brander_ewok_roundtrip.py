"""A template exported from EWOK renders through Brander with the exact
pixels EWOK previewed.

tests/fixtures/ewok-bundle is EWOK's "Download for Brander (.zip)" of the
square iPad example, unzipped, plus expected.png: EWOK's own render of it
(wallrender 0.3.0, Pillow 11.3) for the values Brander builds from this
device record. If this fails, EWOK's preview and the devices disagree:
check that both repos pin the same wallrender and Pillow.
