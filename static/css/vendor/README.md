# Vendored design-system files

`roster-web.css`, `roster-html.css` and `icons.svg` here, and `templates/vendor/roster-macros.html`,
are generated files from roster-bridge, which turns the
[@blakesteve/roster](https://github.com/blakesteve/roster) design tokens into plain CSS and Jinja macros.
The first line of each file names the roster version and a content hash. Do not edit them by hand:
replace them with newer generated copies.

Only the fork's own pages load them: the self-serve device pages (`templates/selfserve/`) and the
Brander pages (`templates/brander/`). The Jamf console pages keep `main.css` and Bootstrap.
