"""Run one timed automation's script and log what it does.

Cron calls this instead of the script itself:

    <venv python> <app dir>/bin/run_cron.py <automation name>

so a timed run's output reaches the JAWA log under the automation's
name, and a non-zero exit is logged as an error and sends the chat
failure alert (if one is set on /setup), the same as a webhook run.
Without it, cron sends the output to the jawa user's local mail, which
nobody reads.

The exit code is the script's own, so cron still sees a failure. The
alert never changes it.
